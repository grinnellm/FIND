# FIND Pacific Herring spawn index locations

Display Pacific Herring spawn index locations around a point.
For more information on Pafic Herring spawn data, contact Jaclyn Cleary, Matthew Grinnell, or Matt Thompson, DFO Science, Pacific Biological Station.
For details on how to calculate the Pacific Herring spawn index, read the (draft spawn index technical report).

## Notes

The 'spawn index' represents the raw survey data only, and is not scaled by the spawn survey scaling parameter q; therefore it is a relative index of spawning biomass (CSAS 2018).

'Incomplete' spawns are included in this analysis; they are indicated by grey circles in the map, and NAs in the table.
These spawns are rare, and they include spawns that were observed but not surveyed, and spawns that were surveyed but have insufficient data to calculate the spawn index.
